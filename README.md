# RDCToolsLib
RDC Tools Base Library

This common library is utilized by other RDC Tools projects and consists of a series of DataFlex standard classes that have been subclassed.

It is important to note that this library is used exclusively by projects on this site, not by other libraries. It is automatically installed when you choose to clone one of the main projects or repositories.

The library provides a unified interface for all applications within the NilsSve repository.
